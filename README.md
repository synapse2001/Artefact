# Structure of the game

- The game has develoved to asses user's soft skill while providing an immersive experience.  



## General Instructions for the game are as follows:

- I recommended to sign in with google for a better user experience.

- I recommend completing all stages in one session, as scores are populated on levels and time taken. 

- Stages are incremented and Time Taken is saved in the daatabse.

- You can always start where you left off.

- Read the instructions on each levels carefully as they are clues to take you forward.

- If you hit a deadend, you can always choose to play again.
